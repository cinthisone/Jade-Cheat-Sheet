Closes #46\n\n0.2.0 / 2010-07-08\n==================\n\n  * Added `- each` support for readable iteration\n  * Added [markdown-js](http://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) support (no compilation required)\n  * Removed node-discount support\n\n0.1.0 / 2010-07-05\n==================\n\n  * Added `${}` support for interpolation.
